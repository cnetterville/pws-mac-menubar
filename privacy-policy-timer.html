      <h1>Privacy Policy for Interval Timer</h1>
      
      <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: September 7, 2025</p>
      
      <p>This Privacy Policy describes how "Interval Timer" (the "App") collects, uses, and discloses information when you use our Apple Watch application.</p>
      
      <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
      
      <p>"Interval Timer" is designed with your privacy in mind. We do not collect any personal information from you. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
      
      <ul>
          <li>Your name, email address, or any other contact information</li>
          <li>Your location data (GPS, IP address, etc.)</li>
          <li>Your workout data, heart rate information, or fitness metrics</li>
          <li>Usage data, analytics, or crash reports</li>
          <li>Device identifiers or Apple Watch serial numbers</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>2. How Your Data is Handled (Locally on Your Device)</h2>
      
      <p>The App processes all workout timing data, heart rate measurements, and fitness information entirely on your Apple Watch and paired iPhone. All data from your workouts, including:</p>
      
      <ul>
          <li>Interval timing and workout duration</li>
          <li>Heart rate data collected via Apple Watch sensors</li>
          <li>Workout statistics and progress</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>This information is processed and stored locally on your devices and integrated with Apple's HealthKit framework when you grant permission. No workout or health data is ever transmitted to us or any third parties by the App.</p>
      
      <h2>3. HealthKit Integration</h2>
      
      <p>When you choose to enable HealthKit integration, your workout data is shared directly with Apple's Health app according to Apple's privacy policies. We do not have access to this data - it remains between your device and Apple's secure health platform.</p>
      
      <h2>4. No Third-Party Access to Your Information</h2>
      
      <p>Since we do not collect any personal, workout, or health data, there is no information for us to share with third parties.</p>
      
      <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
      
      <p>As we do not collect or store any of your data on external servers, there is no personal data to secure beyond your device. Your workout and health data remains securely on your Apple Watch, iPhone, and within Apple's HealthKit ecosystem.</p>
      
      <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
      
      <p>Our App does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. As such, we are in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).</p>
      
      <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      
      <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the App Store listing. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted.</p>
      
      <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
